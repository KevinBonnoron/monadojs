# Prop

`prop` (and by extension `props`) is an operator that return a property from an object. Can be very useful when trying to extract some properties or to filter data in combinaison with [filter](../filter/index.md) or [reduce](../reduce/index.md).

`prop` returns one property while `prop` returns an array of properties
